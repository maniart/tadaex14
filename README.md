Code base for a 2-session workshop on realtime web-based audiovisual systems at TADAEX '14 (Tehran Annual Digital Arts Festival 2014 @ Darbast Projects)

### Workshop Title:
Realtime web-based audiovisual systems

### Description:
Through examples and hands-on experiments, in two sessions we will explore the basics of creating engaging and playful systems for creating collaborative realtime audiovisual systems on the web. We will look at inspiring examples and exmploy a number of techniques and libraries to turn our browser into an interactive canvas. Two sessions is not enough time to delve deep into both theory and practice, but it should provide an intro-level course to get started experimenting and creating.

### Requirements:
Participants should be familiar with basic web technologies or have basic understanding of programming concepts. Moreover, participants should be curious to write experimental software as creative medium.  

### Equipment:
* A wireless network
* A few web cams (laptop cams are fine)
* A few smart phones (if participants have smart phones, that's fine) 

### Prerequisites:
* **Knowledge:**
	* Basic programming knowledge 
	* Basic understanding of web technologies
	* Basic command line skills
	* Basic git knowledge 
* **Software:**
	* Latest version of Google Chrome (~37)
	* git + github account
	* node.js + npm
	* IDE (sublime text, textmate, coda, textWrangler notepad++, atom, etc.)
* **Hardware:**
	* Computer - Laptop
	* Web cam (optional - as input device)
	* Smartphones (optional - as input device)
